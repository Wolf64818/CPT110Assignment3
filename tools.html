  <p>This is a brief description of what we have done during our project, a link to the  group’s website, the link to our group’s Git repository (GitHub), and some comments on how well the audit trail on the Git repository reflects your group’s work. </p>

  <p>Link to the Team: ONLY SUPPLIED IN THE PDF:</p>

  <p>Our group worked together to create the basic outline of a project that would help students learn the potentially dangerous field of electrical tradesman-ship.   It was important that these students could learn in a safe environment, and VR was studied as a way that our students could do this.  We discussed, research and thought of some of the best ways we could create this course and this project report looks at some of the approaches and the deliverables of our work. 
Our GitHub trail shows who uploaded what, and who wrote what, which was important to show the lecturers the components that people did and what they did when.  It was an effective strategy that allows everyone (group members and lecturers) alike to see the time in which things were completed and which sections were completed by whom. </p>
