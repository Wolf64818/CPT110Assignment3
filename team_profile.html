	<h2>Adam Song</h2>
	<p>Student Number: s3918373 <br> Student Email address: s3918373@student.rmit.edu.au <br>  I am 18 years old from Brisbane, Queensland. My parents were both born in Australia, but my father’s parents were Chinese immigrants. Even though my grandmother still speaks Cantonese, I only speak English. I finished year 12 last year and was to travel overseas but this was stopped by COVID-19 restrictions. I enjoy gaming as a hobby and it’s also my work as a professional player. A lot of my friends are IT professionals, and it is through this I developed an interest in studying IT, as I feel it will be a good area for future work. My only experience in IT is the subjects that I did at school. I chose RMIT because of its open entry policy for the Bachelor of Information Technology, and because the course is online, I can do it from anywhere. I expect to learn about different networks, their design and administration, software development, website design and security.  I am interested in using the course as a base for further study in computer science or cyber-security. I hope to find an area I really enjoy and develop skills to work in this area.  Currently studies with group The Last of Us.</p>
	
	<h2>Trill</h2>

	<p>Student Number: 3910969 <br> Student email: S3910969@rmit.edu.au <br> Trill is a part of the Group The Last of US and enjoys spending any free time reading, writing, coding and working on IT projects at home.  A lot of the enthusiasm for IT and Computers began at a young age, when first learning alongside and encouraged by a father who loved to code and learn himself.  First projects included tinkering with Raspberry Pis, learning many coding languages and finally grew into a fervent fascination with anything that had a hard drive. Having completed Year 12, gained excellent STAT scores and further tertiary education, Trill's next move is probably chasing down a degree that offers to solve truly interesting and challenging problems - whether that be in cyber security, software development or general IT. </p>
	
	<h2>Valantino</h2>

	<p>Student Number: s3915298  <br> Student Email: s3915298@student.rmit.edu.au  <br> Hello my name is Valantino and I am an aspiring game and web developer born in South Sudan then later migrated to Australia at the age of 6 and I’ve lived here ever since. I enjoy a lot of physical activity sports such as soccer dancing and boxing also enjoy non-physical activities like gaming editing and content creating. Why I have decided to choose the path of information technology is because when I was in high school, I noticed that I really enjoyed using and playing with tech and from that it led me to choose multimedia as one of my core subjects and from their learned to use software's like photoshop, after effects, adobe illustrator and Dreamweaver. Now I have decided to take the next step in my learning journey through RMIT.   Currently studies with group The Last of Us.</p>
	
	<h2>Luke</h2>

	<p>Luke Adie, Student Number: s3782475, Email - S3782475@student.rmit.edu.au My name is Luke, I am currently studying IT at RMIT whilst working full time as part of a retail management team. Although I was born here, my Mum is from Turkey, where I get my cultural background from. My favourite hobby in my downtime is working on and driving cars! I currently own a 1994 Toyota Supra that I have rebuilt after being rear ended 2 months after getting the car. It has taken over a year, but it is now looking better than ever! I first got interested in IT from my love of gaming. I was a complete nerd and would play for hours on end with my brother, always challenging each other to be the best, however he would always come out on top due to the age difference. I have IT experience mainly from self-learning such as video editing, programming, game modifying and photo editing.</p>

	<h2>Comparison and Analysis of test results</h2>
	
	<p>As Adam writes, Information about a person’s personality and learning style helps students look at their strengths and how they respond in different settings.    A ‘Myers-Briggs’ test (16 Personalities, n.d)  gives answers rated into one of four different groups:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Analysts (Intuitive and Thinking Personality types known for their rationality, impartiality, and intellectual excellence) </li>
		<li>Diplomats (Intuitive and Feeling personality types known for their empathy, diplomatic skills and passionate idealism)</li>
		<li>Sentinels (Observant and judging personality types known for their practicality and focus on order, security and stability) </li>
		<li>Explorers (Observant and prospecting personality types known for their spontaneity, ingenuity, and flexibility). </li>
	</ul>

	<p>Trill reflected that there is a fair amount of overlap with 75% of the group being Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling and Judging.  With this great combination of cross overs this could indicate that there is going to be a particularly good mix between the team and that everyone will be able to work each other efficiently and productively.</p>

	<p>Adam is an Explorer who is an Adventurer – someone who is Introverted, Observant, Feeling and Prospecting. Adventurers tend to have open minds, approaching life, new experiences and people with grounded warmth. Their ability to stay in the moment helps them uncover exciting potentials.</p>

	<p>Trill is an Architect.  Architects are known for having a firmly logical grounded approach to anything they take on board (16Personalities, n.d).  They are constantly problem solving, striving for answers – and they apply this to any area they work in.  It doesn’t matter what their career ends up being they are invested in finding the most efficient way of achieving something – the cheapest way of creating something; etc.    Forever learning and forever curious, an INTJ will always be inspired to learn and understand the world around them (16Personalities, n.d).</p>

	<p>Through the Meyer-Briggs test, Luke have found that he was a “Protagonist”. This showed him that he was extraverted, intuitive, a feeler rather than a thinker, judging when it comes to his approach to work and turbulent.  He has seen to be a “natural-born leader” – passionate and charismatic.  Luke is an Auditory Learner. This means that I learn best by hearing and listening and can understand and remember things that I have heard.</p>

	<p>Valantino is an Advocate.  To paraphrase (16Personalities, n.d) , they leave their mark on the world. They have a deep sense of idealism and integrity, but they aren’t idle dreamers – they take concrete steps to realize their goals and make a lasting impact. Advocates’ unique combination of personality traits makes them complex and quite versatile. For example, Advocates can speak with great passion and conviction, especially when standing up for their ideals. At other times, however, they may choose to be soft-spoken and understated, preferring to keep the peace rather than challenge others.  Advocates generally strive to do what’s right – and they want to help create a world where others do the right thing as well. People with this personality type may feel called to use their strengths – including creativity, imagination, and sensitivity – to uplift others and spread compassion. Concepts like egalitarianism and karma can mean a great deal to Advocates (16Personalities, n.d).  Advocates may see helping others as their purpose in life. They are troubled by injustice, and they typically care more about altruism than personal gain. As a result, Advocates tend to step in when they see someone facing unfairness or hardship. Many people with this personality type also aspire to fix society’s deeper problems, in the hope that unfairness and hardship can become things of the past (16Personalities, n.d).</p>
