<p><strong>By the time you get to the end of the semester, you should have been working as a group for nearly ten weeks, and so you will have been able to judge how well your group is performing. As in Assignment 2, each of you should login to the SparkPLUS tool to provide an assessment of each person in the group, including themselves. This will then provide feedback to each of you, and in particular on how the rest of the team view’s you performance.  You do not need to include any information about the feedback you receive, as this is intended to give you experience with use of tools such as these, and how the information is gathered and processed in such tools. The markers will, however, check that each person in the group has contributed via SparkPLUS, and the marks for this section will only be awarded if all group members have contributed in an appropriate manner by the assignment deadline.</strong></p>

<p>This is a reminder that this section will need to be filled out by all the active team members. Thanks guy!!</p>
