<p>Everyone was to contribute and talk and reflect as a group on the progress made throughout this project, including what went well,
what could be improved, at least one thing that was surprising and at least one thing that you have learned about groups.</p>


<h2>Trill</h2>

<p>Starting out with a new group is always interesting and for me it was especially so with this group as the Project Idea was unknown, as was the dynamic, strengths and weaknesses of my team members.   One of the most challenging moments for me in my new group was waiting for contact in the first few weeks and worrying that we might not have enough time to get everything done.  However, within the space of two weeks my group contacted me, and I was delighted by how fun, kind and interested they were in their project. The beginning three weeks were tricky because little contact was made and towards the end of the project this time would have been incredibly useful for the group. </p>

<p>However, this is not to say that work was not done in the meantime and at the end of the day what worked was everyone's enthusiasm and willingness to work together.</p>

<p>What I thought worked well:</p>

<ul>
<li>It was extremely easy to fit in around other people’s schedules and find a time to set up meetings (the first hurdle of the group was contacting times) </li>
<li>Once we had met, it was quick to assign jobs, and to talk to people about how to allocate sections.  Adam and Valantino were incredibly happy to choose a part of the project or be allocated it and start work towards it. </li>
<li>Everyone was engaged with problem solving to find the style and complexity of the deliverables we would be presenting at the close of our group project </li>
<li>Meetings were quite frequent which meant that we could quickly decide if someone needed help in a certain area, or was simply not going to be able to meet targets </li>
</ul>

<h3>At least one thing that was surprising</h3>

<p>I thought I would be joining a group of 7 who were already working hard towards the project and that I might not have the best dynamic with a team who had already been working with each other for many weeks – as the latest addition to a team I thought it would be hard to fit in, but it was easy given that currently there were only 4 team members that were active, and all upon meeting, were very friendly. </p>

<p>The workload surprised me – particularly, how quickly it built up and how much extra detail I provided for each section.  For work to truly shine, many hours need to go into even the smallest of sections and I spent extra time over the areas assigned to me to ensure they sounded as clear or informative as possible.</p>



	<h2>Valantino</h2>

	<p>Over all working with this group in assignment 3 has been a less stressful experience all around because this time we communicated well and got to know each other earlier and thanks to trillion we got straight into the project and meetings early on which made things a little easier this time around. Personally for me challenges I ran into was just finding time and being as productive in that space of time not procrastinating I found that really most challenging considering all the distractions like my phone or family members asking for help around the house, As for my team mates they were really awesome and supportive giving me a hand whenever I needed it throughout the project like helping me out with plans and progress writing down small dot points which I could later go on to expand them and turn them into paragraphs and helping me with making references in my paragraphs, they also found out certain sections of the assignment that would be better suited for me and my level of skills and knowledge so I could not run fewer problems while I’m working on them and so that’s my take on my group and how well they performed throughout the project.</p>
