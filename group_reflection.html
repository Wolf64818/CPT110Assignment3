<p>Everyone was to contribute and talk and reflect as a group on the progress made throughout this project, including what went well,
what could be improved, at least one thing that was surprising and at least one thing that you have learned about groups.</p>

<h2>Group</h2>

	<p>Everyone has come together multiple times during the course of this project to talk about the positive and negative aspects of group work.  As everyone has had their own experiences of group work to date, many lessons can be learned for future developments or projects.  One of the most important moments of any group is to come together and talk about the progress made by each person and collectively as a group.   Some of the biggest challenges for the group Adam and Valantino were together for the Assessment 2 project and have expressed how the size of the group made it tricky to get work done on time as a higher level of work was required to be completed by many less hands than nominal.  However, everyone was happy and committed to working together despite differences in family and life commitments, hectic work schedules and work was done by all active three members of the group. </p>

	<p>People working together felt as though they were supported in the roles that they had been matched with, and tasks and project materials were discussed thoroughly and in a way that was accessible to all.  It was important to everyone was comfortable with their work load.  The group was efficient and conducted itself well during its meetings, often speaking to the point and promptly dealing with any and all complications / rabbit holes that came about through the further research and discussion of our project.  People were able to work together at all hours to find solutions to situations where time constraints, running costs or even technological deficits would impede the creation of 'deliverable’ results for our project.  Everyone agreed that the time commitments should have been increased for the project to have come to a better place by the due date, but it was good that everyone was happy to work together. </p>

	<p>To aid the understand of the group’s processes, the meeting minutes have been included below the individual perspectives of each of the active members of the group (Valantino, Trill and Adam).  Also discussed is how well the GitHub Commits reflected the logs of activities. As Trill was responsible for uploading each section, every comment reflected who had made the materials for the ease of understanding which components were done by each person.  It actively reflects who worked on which component and shows the edits along the way. </p>
	
<h2>Trill</h2>

<p>Starting out with a new group is always interesting and for me it was especially so with this group as the Project Idea was unknown, as was the dynamic, strengths and weaknesses of my team members.   One of the most challenging moments for me in my new group was waiting for contact in the first few weeks and worrying that we might not have enough time to get everything done.  However, within the space of two weeks my group contacted me, and I was delighted by how fun, kind and interested they were in their project. The beginning three weeks were tricky because little contact was made and towards the end of the project this time would have been incredibly useful for the group. </p>

<p>However, this is not to say that work was not done in the meantime and at the end of the day what worked was everyone's enthusiasm and willingness to work together.  </p>

<p>What I thought worked well:  </p>

<ul>
	<li>It was extremely easy to fit in around other people’s schedules and find a time to set up meetings (the first hurdle of the group was contacting times)</li>
	<li>Once we had met, it was quick to assign jobs, and to talk to people about how to allocate sections.  Adam and Valantino were incredibly happy to choose a part of the project or be allocated it and start work towards it. </li>
	<li>Everyone was engaged with problem solving to find the style and complexity of the deliverables we would be presenting at the close of our group project</li>
	<li>Meetings were quite frequent which meant that we could quickly decide if someone needed help in a certain area, or was simply not going to be able to meet targets </li>
</ul>

<p>A few things that were surprising for me: </p>

<ul>
	<li>Group size & dynamic</li>
	<li>The workload facing us</li>
	<li>The meeting run times </li
	<li>Changes to the original plan</li>
</ul>

<p>The group size was one of the first things that surprised me; when I joined this group, I thought I would be joining a group of seven who were already working hard towards the project and therefore that I might not have the best dynamic with a team who had already been working with each other for many weeks – as the latest addition to a team I thought it would be hard to fit in.  However, this was not the case, as our group currently has three active members, including myself, and upon meeting, were very friendly.  I found it incredibly easy to get along with my new teammates and work together with them on our VR project.  I was included and involved in a way I thought might not be possible.  Everyone is friendly and outgoing, and this experience is welcoming. </p>

<p>The workload, perhaps, surprised me most – particularly, how quickly it built up, and how much extra detail I realised I should be providing for each section.  For work to truly shine, many hours need to go into even the smallest of sections, and I spent extra time over the areas assigned to me to ensure they sounded as clear or informative as possible.  This work was also applied to other areas that I volunteered for or contributed, as it became clear a fourth group member wasn’t going to be actively contributing to this project. </p>

<p>I was proud and surprised with how well our meeting system worked.  Meetings were concise and to the point and, combined with our increased frequency of meetings, it allowed us to prioritise a few vital points in each session.  This meant that at every meeting the goals that needed to be achieved were clear, and without taking more time than necessary.  Short and to the point is key when working on a big project because if the meetings are too long then information, tasks and duties can be forgotten or overlooked. </p>

<p>The ability of our group to come up with new solutions to problems with aspects of our project was inspirational.  For instance, one of the earliest work arounds was when we realised with the shipping times, the arrival date of our VR headset would fall past the due date ( 22nd of August ) of our assignment.  But in moments like these our group was able to problem solve and approach the project from a different angle and think of the next best possible ‘mock-up’ or possible way of realising our project’s aims.  It was interesting to see this occur multiple times over the course of our project as we worked around dead-ends and time restrictions.  This proved our groups abilities to work to deadlines and prioritise the best methods of producing deliverables towards our project. </p>

<p>There were also several lessons I learned during this group work, including: </p>

<ul>
	<li>Getting started earlier</li>
	<li>Making allocations sooner</li>
	<li>Understand there will be delays and combat it with appropriate measures</li>
	<li>Checking in more frequently</li>
</ul>

<p>Getting started earlier would have helped our group plan our approach lot better.  This has a trickle-down effect because the sooner we start working collaboratively as a group, the sooner everyone can volunteer/assign tasks for each other, and work towards those.  In the beginning there was a week or so of no contact and although some work was done as individuals the time would have been better spent as a group in discussions about what angle to take and what kinds of things we wanted to include. </p>

<p>One of the hardest lessons to learn about group projects is to understand that there will be delays, and that some sections will take longer than originally thought.  In our group this is especially true as we are not seven but three members, and almost all of us are classed as essential workers.  This means that we are often communicating with each other after long shifts and sometimes even late at night, to manage everyone’s schedules.  In a group that has a high amount of commitments outside studies it can be hard to find the time to work towards a common goal.  One of the best approaches for this is to understand and assume that there will be time delays and move to compensate efficiently and strategically.  This can be done by people doing extra work during periods of time when others cannot; or even by helping to collaborate with others.  There is a joint responsibility of each member to acknowledge when they need extra help and when they are able to provide a supporting hand to writing, proof reading or editing.  </p>

<p>Group communications is a huge area for improvement I see, in that the only way that we can work as a group is if we understand what are the things that each of us must do and when we should accomplish them by.  In a group setting where the roles, deliverables and even the main focus can change through the development and creation phases, there should always be an efficient and successful method of contact.  There have been many times during the first few weeks where would be no contact between anyone and this hindered the process of our project. </p>

<p>The time and commitment to the project is another area I see in which an improvement would benefit the group. </p>


<h2>Valantino</h2>

	<p>Over all working with this group in assignment 3 has been a less stressful experience all around because this time we communicated well and got to know each other earlier and thanks to trillion we got straight into the project and meetings early on which made things a little easier this time around. Personally for me challenges I ran into was just finding time and being as productive in that space of time not procrastinating I found that really most challenging considering all the distractions like my phone or family members asking for help around the house, As for my team mates they were really awesome and supportive giving me a hand whenever I needed it throughout the project like helping me out with plans and progress writing down small dot points which I could later go on to expand them and turn them into paragraphs and helping me with making references in my paragraphs, they also found out certain sections of the assignment that would be better suited for me and my level of skills and knowledge so I could not run fewer problems while I’m working on them and so that’s my take on my group and how well they performed throughout the project.</p>
	
	
	<h2>Adam</h2>
    <p>After only having three people for Assignment 2, I knew how hard that was and how we were pushed for time and had trouble completing all the tasks. I was relieved to think we would have seven this time, only to find that it ended up only being three of us again. We were a bit slow to start again, which wasn’t helped by having no contact with so many members. Valentino and I had already worked together, so we knew how each other worked and that we’d get there. Trillion was our new member and she was keen to make contact. That really helped us to focus and make a better start. It still took us a while to assign tasks, and we could have done that earlier.</p>  

<p>The meetings we had worked well. Last time we tried to do a lot of work during the meeting, so they were long and not that effective. This time they were short, and everyone knew what they had to do before the next meeting. It didn’t always work to time, but even if we weren’t finished, it helped us be accountable and trust the other group members to get their sections done. I think our trust improved over time because our communication was good, and we had no hesitation sending messages and asking questions. </p>

<p>The workload for the project was quite a bit as there was a lot of detail and we weren’t familiar with how to do many of the tasks. This is where having only three members makes a difference, especially when you are trying to fit it in with other subjects and work commitments. But the three of us got on well, and everyone just took responsibility for tasks, and helped each other when we could. In some ways that might be easier than working with a larger number of people with different ideas and personalities. </p>

<p>Overall, it was a good experience despite the amount of work because everyone was supportive, and we all tried to work out how to keep moving forward. As someone who is usually quieter in a group setting, I think this group really helped me to see that things were much easier with good communication and when everyone does their part. </p>
