<h3>Topic</h3>
  <p><em>An overview of what you propose to do in your project. Concentrate on the big picture and outcomes, rather than intricate details. At least two paragraphs is expected.</em></p>

  
<h3>Motivation</h3>
  <p><em>What are your motivations for your project. Why is this project important or interesting? How does it fit in with current IT trends? What would it show to a future employer if you were able to work on this project? At least one paragraph is expected.</em></p>

<h3>Landscape</h3>
  <p><em>What similar systems or products are available? What competitors are there? What points of difference are there about your project compared to what exist now? At least one paragraph is expected.</em></p>

<h2>Detailed Description</h2>	
 
<h3>Aims</h3>
  <p><em>The topic description gives a general overview. However, it is usually helpful to have a specific aim for your project, as well as some smaller goals which will be helpful for achieving your aim. Describe these as best you can. Each project should have a single aim. What are the most important parts of the project? Which parts should have priority over the others? If we have only enough time or resources for one of our goals, which one should it be?. </em></p>

<h3>Group Processes and communications</h3>

  <p><strong>Communication was described by the Assessment as one of the most important parts of the project - often the component that would have most influence over 'making' or 'breaking' the success of the project.  This section analyses the communcation processes between group members.</strong</p>

<p>Group processes and communications were set out during the first meeting of the group.  The main method of communication is through the following: </p>

<p>Canvas Outlook – emails were sent back and forth in the first early few weeks to group to decide what to do and  </p>

<p>Communication between group members is one of the most important components which can make or break a team.  It is incredibly important that people can negotiate, and problem solve together during each part of the project, including between meetings as often problems with an idea or concept change might be necessary before completing a specific task by an agreed date. </p>

<p>One of the ways our team decided to communicate was to rely only upon Outlook and Microsoft Team.  This way no one was excluded from any of the discussions that were taking place and it met the specifications for the Assignment.  It was important to all of us that our conversations and negotiations were all equally valid. </p>

<p>Outlook was an important tool – we used this to send emails to each other and allowed the last member of the group, Trillion, to gain access to Microsoft Teams, which then became the dominant form of all communications, especially for our meetings.  Microsoft Teams was used in many ways including for meetings, chatting, and sharing specs and files. </p>

<p>Our meetings were decided to take place three times a week, more often than necessary but a useful idea because with increased frequency work could potentially move along faster.  This also improved connectivity between members and helped establish repour and friendships with each other; as there was a new member in the group a new dynamic was formed very easily with these extra meetings.  It also allowed the group to catch up as work had been hindered by poor communication in the first two weeks.  With a group comprising at least two essential workers in separate states it was sometimes not possible for all members to partake in meetings at the same time, but happily at least two out of three were able to attend the meetings each time. </p>

<p>How will your group communicate? How often will meetings take place? Will these be face-to-face, or using technologies such as Skype? Or Facebook? Or email? Or text? Or ...?? What will you do if you have a group member who does not respond to communications? </p>

<p>As we were separated by many hundreds of kilometres Microsoft Meetings was one of the only ways our group could meet. </p>

<p>One of the first things to come up in group discussion was the lack of contact from the other members in the group.  Although there is a count of seven on Canvas there are in actuality only three members who wrote materials towards this Assessment 3, namely Trill, Adam and Valantino (with Lukes’ material added in the first two weeks by Trill, but who never made any contact).  This was discussed as early as the first two meetings and in the second it was decided that if a member became inactive for a period of around a week at this late date we would just complete their materials. </p>

<p>If a group member was inactive for a period of more than a few weeks we would overtake everything they needed to do and we would give them no contribution share on the project.  This was something the group decided to do as a whole in part due to the number of things facing the completion of this project, and partly because of the time available to us. </p>

<p>Communication was often through Microsoft Team chats, in which the members communicated information about the project such as due dates or presentation strategies everyone could see the materials and access them.  In this way we incorporated everyone’s input and expression. </p>
