<h3>Motivation</h3>
  <p><em>What are your motivations for your project. Why is this project important or interesting? How does it fit in with current IT trends? What would it show to a future employer if you were able to work on this project? At least one paragraph is expected.</em></p>

<h2>Detailed Description</h2>	
 
<h3>Aims</h3>
  <p><em>The topic description gives a general overview. However, it is usually helpful to have a specific aim for your project, as well as some smaller goals which will be helpful for achieving your aim. Describe these as best you can. Each project should have a single aim. What are the most important parts of the project? Which parts should have priority over the others? If we have only enough time or resources for one of our goals, which one should it be?. </em></p>
