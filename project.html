<h3>Topic</h3>
  <p><em>An overview of what you propose to do in your project. Concentrate on the big picture and outcomes, rather than intricate details. At least two paragraphs is expected.</em></p>

	 <p>SparksVR is a program that is designed to help students learn without being ‘on the site’.  It is designed to help those from Years 10-12, TAFE students and those interested in an Electrical Apprenticeship.  In a field which may a lot of work with powerlines or power stations, electrical appliances and even unsafe connections or outlets, it is incredibly important that these learners begin to approach learning about these situations in a safe environment.   These are going to be the future electricians, tradespeople and electrical engineers so it is important that learning is safe and even when replicating a potentially dangerous situation. </p>

 	<p>This project focuses on a VR course, and the aim is that our students can take this course at home by logging into their paid account through their course provider (who would be government accredited and TAFE certified) and with their VR headset be able to be immersed in the ‘VR classroom’ where an instructor can point out situations, guide them through different potentially fatal situations, and even do case studying analysis on past fata situations.  This would revolutionise the way students are taught because they could fully engage with a dangerous situation without feeling the full effects of their inexperience, or mistakes.  The course would use VR headset and VR gloves to prepare students to feel some of the same things that an electrician would; for instance, feeling the cables in their hands as they prepared them for soldering, feeling a soft ‘buzz’ to inform them they would have suffered a dangerous electrical contact. </p>

 	<p>The course would go through several different scenes and be broken down into several different areas so that our students could work through the basics of electrical engineering or trades work (re-wiring, soldering, diagnosing electrical problems, fixing circuits, installing appliances, maintaining networks, etc) and learn about the different spaces some of these things are done (industrial settings, government buildings, homes, retail places etc).  By the end of the VR course a student would have worked in multiple settings of an electrical engineer/tradesperson and walk away with a Certificate accrediting them to start their Apprenticeship or Electrical Engineering degree. </p>

 	<p>This course would get students into a classroom without having to leave their homes, so would make the lives of those people studying easier as they completed their accreditation.  Because the course would be through VR they would feel as though they were ‘actually there’ - be that at the workplace, the house where they were installing an oven, etc. It would empower and excite so many future learners. </p>

	
  
<h3>Motivation</h3>
  <p><em>What are your motivations for your project. Why is this project important or interesting? How does it fit in with current IT trends? What would it show to a future employer if you were able to work on this project? At least one paragraph is expected.</em></p>
  
  <p>Motivation What are your motivations for your project. Why is this project important or interesting? How does it fit in with current IT trends? What would it show to a future employer if you were able to work on this project? At least one paragraph is expected. </p>

  <p>There is more than one motivation behind this project, but broadly the purpose of this project is to minimise accidents and serious injuries in the process of learning the skills involved with becoming an electrical engineer or tradesperson. Almost all group members have friends or family that work in the electrical engineering trade, so all have experienced first-hand the consequences when something goes wrong during training – or even in the field those first few times.  All of us have a friend or family member who has had a bad electric shock.   The motivation behind this project is to prevent accidents from occurring with the frequency with which they do now – and even prevent them from occurring during the training process. </p>

  <p>It was revealed (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare and Flinders University, 2018) that around half the deaths for the period 2015-2016 this period was by paid workers, an alarming statistic for many in the trade. The deaths were often preventable so could have been minimised with better training. </p>

  <p>Better training could be the result of an educational program that not only provides up-to-date knowledge but does so in a way that is entirely engaging and compelling.   It has been known for a while that people learn best by doing (N, Babich, 2018) but it matters that this can be done safely in a highly specialised and sometimes dangerous areas as the electrical trade.  If something goes wrong, there is no re-wind button on death, and some serious injuries. </p>

  <p>The project uses VR technology as a tool that provides an immersive experience that transports the user to the site of the work, whether that be in a field reconstructing power lines or in a house checking an appliance, without ever risking their own personal safety whilst learning. </p>

  <p>This project is interesting because it would directly impact the education of the students who partook in its training.  VR education (N, Babich, 2018) around the world is changing the way students are learning and immersive nature means that many times can feel like the real thing, only with no consequences for not properly following a procedure or forgetting a certain step in a real class – or worse, in real life. </p>

  <p>It fits in incredibly well with the current IT trends, in which we are seeing an increasing interest in the use of VR technology, capability and expansion.  Statistics (Petrov, C, 2021) point out that by the end of 2021 VR consumer virtual and software is going to reach approximately $3.7 billion – whereas by 2024 this is expected to grow to $72.8 billion.  There are a number of other statistics that point to the general adoption and acceptance of the use of VR and or AR, with standalone VR headsets (headsets designed to be used without connection to a laptop of desk computer) sales approximately zero in 2017 and are expected to be as high as 29 million in 2022 (Petrov, C, 2021). </p>

  <p>This project would show a potential employee we can work as a team productively and practise the following skill sets: </p>

  <ul>
  	<li>Good team working skills</li>
	<li>Motivation </li>
	<li>Excellent research skills </li>
    <li>Great ideas formulation and drive </li>
    <li>Problem solving and planning </li>
 </ul>

<h3>Landscape</h3>
  <p><em>What similar systems or products are available? What competitors are there? What points of difference are there about your project compared to what exist now? At least one paragraph is expected.</em></p>
  
  	<p>There are similar systems and products available, as VR and Augmented reality are already used in a lot of classrooms around the world, because of the benefits it provides students.  There are students in UK, Australia and New Zealand who have benefited from this education.  It has been shown that VR helps engage students and inspire students and keeps them learning longer (Immersion VR, 2020). Fully immersed in a world, students are more interested in the materials being presented, and it can save either the schools or parents money and time to implement these experiences (Immersion VR, n.d).  It is beneficial to the learning process as the student can see what the actual steps of a procedure might be, and then practise in an interactive VR environment.  By getting feedback from their actions in this VR landscape they can learn as though they were actually there in the workplace (ClassVR, 2020). </p>

	<p>There are currently competitors out there in the global and national markets suing VR as a means for educational purposes.  Both augmented and Virtual reality is currently being used in courses to provide worked in vocational training the safety of practising again and again without fear of expense or danger.  One system ClassVR currently offers Virtual and Augmented reality courses (throughout the world) which allow students to learn through this manner (ClassVR, 2020) for their medical and trade courses.  And there are other companies who have currently developed either headsets or immersive classroom tools (Smith, S, 2021).  A few others are Immersive VR in England offering VR headsets and 3D classroom experiences for primary and high school students, mostly for the use of life like trips to different countries, and even in Czech Republic and China, students are learning medicine with the help of VR (Smith, S, 2021).  Many of these have used headsets and hand controllers. </p>

	<p>There even been VR projects in Australia, and one notable case happened in NSW in two government funded schools.  “It became the first research internationally to embed high-end VR in school classrooms.” (Southgate, E, 2020).  As impressive as this is it did shine light on to the possibilities of what would need to be improved for future students to be able to access this equipment easily and through other course providers. </p>

	<p>This is how our course will be different.  It hopes to be the first VR course that is approved by TAFE for use in the educational industry for the training of the country’s future electricians. </p>

<h2>Detailed Description</h2>	
 
<h3>Aims</h3>
  <p><em>The topic description gives a general overview. However, it is usually helpful to have a specific aim for your project, as well as some smaller goals which will be helpful for achieving your aim. Describe these as best you can. Each project should have a single aim. What are the most important parts of the project? Which parts should have priority over the others? If we have only enough time or resources for one of our goals, which one should it be?. </em></p>

  <p>The aim of 'Sparks VR’ is to develop an educational tool for students interested in a career as an Electrician. It is important that the program educates these students in not only what an Electrician does, but also the skills and knowledge that are necessary to be successful. The target audience is Year 10-12 High School students, TAFE students and those interested in an Electrical Apprenticeship. The tasks will be designed in conjunction with industry professionals and consider government standards. The satisfactory completion of the program will result in a ‘Certificate of Completion’ that can be used by future employers to determine that the candidate has a basic knowledge of what is involved in the profession, and a basic awareness of the necessary skills and safety issues.</p>

  <p>Goal 1: Inform and educate the user about the role of the Electrician and what skills are involved. General electricians are employed in a wide range of areas - they ‘install, test, connect, commission, maintain and modify electrical equipment, wiring and control systems’ (joboutlook.gov.au, 2021). The trade is expected to have a strong future growth, and that combined with its level of pay, makes it appealing to job seekers. ‘SparksVR’ provides the perfect platform to inform students about the range of job opportunities that are available to electricians. Tasks can be developed to incorporate areas that are not usually identified without prior knowledge. This not only provides knowledge but increases a student's likelihood of following it as a career.</p>

<p>Goal 2: Give the user ‘virtual’ real world experience in what it’s like to work as an Electrician. This includes participation in a range of ‘virtual’ tasks involving basic practical skills. As with many trades, electricians are required to not only have a strong knowledge base, but also perform a range of skills and activities that are physically and mentally challenging. These include handling, positioning, and moving objects, lifting, climbing, balancing, attention to detail, identifying different colours, planning and problem-solving (joboutlook.gov.au, 2021). Each of these skills translates well to virtual reality tasks. This program can provide these practical skills in a way that students can have fun and enjoy while learning. </p>

<p>Goal 3: Allow the user to identify the safety issues faced by Electricians and understand the importance of following safety guidelines. It is well documented that working as an electrician is high risk, and it is important that they can combine their knowledge and skills with the ability to identify risks and adapt quickly to help minimise accidents and injury (Hernandez et al., 2016, p. 116). ‘SparksVR’ provides an ideal learning situation to help students identify these risks and see how they react when things going wrong. The program can simulate real situations and let the student discover what happens when different options are taken.  </p>

<p>Each of these goals are important and work together to make sure ‘SparksVR’ will achieve its aim. However, if time or resources are limited, there is scope to combine goals because of the overlap between skills and knowledge. </p>

<h3>Plans and Progress</h3>

  <strong>Plans and Progress report</strong>

<h3>Roles</h3>
  
  <strong>Project leader/Manager</strong>

  <p>The role of the project leader/Manager is the one that is leading the team in the project and does things such as motivating the team members so that the project is done with maximum capacity and effort and that everyone can give it their best shot second is making sure that the project in its completion to go through and see if there was anything missed or small details that changes could be made to and third keeping the team engaged focused so that the project can reach its goal later in its finalization lastly testing the project and products that go through making the project, The project manager role is similar but has its differences such as managing and resolving issues as they arise and identifying potential risks and creating plans if they occur, delivering updates on the progress and possible obstacles facing a project for example if one member of the team made some changes the manager in later meetings can bring it to the attention of the rest of the team so that they know which direction the project is leaning towards and finally keeping the team organized as so that things run smoothly.</p>

<p><em>Team member</em></p>

  <p>A project Team member in our project which does not consist of 1 specific role but they contribute in all aspects of the project like helping with identifying risks and problems with the project and coming up with solutions to counteract them, or help with things such as development of the website and commenting and giving suggestions on things that can be implemented so that the website comes out looking at its best, documenting the process in which the project was done like necessary steps that were taken so that the end goal was of the project was reached, completing individual tasks that might have been assigned to him/her by the project manager and completing them by the due date and finally providing expertise in aspects of the project they might have more experience in or giving recommendation’s on certain products and programs they have used in the past and worked or have failed.  </p>

<p><strong>Web developer’s</strong></p>

  <p>The role of the web developers is to oversee everything that goes into development of the website. They look after scheduling when the project will start and by what date it is to be completed by front-end developers work with the layouts provided to them by UI designers and transform static interface images into a fully functional web app client-side. Their skills include programming in HTML5, CSS, JavaScript and work with front-end libraries and frameworks (Bootstrap, Foundation, Semantic UI, Angular, React JS, etc. Back-end developers are responsible for creating the server side of a web app and are proficient in either PHP, Python, Java, .NET, or Ruby on Rails, as well as in the tools and web app frameworks based on them. In any web development team, the main task of these developers is to ensure that the back end handles the data it receives and sends back to the front end in a correct, secure, and stable way. </p>

 <h3>Testing Specialist</h3>

  <p>The duties of the testing specialist is to test the final product and give feedback to the developers of things they should consider making changes to in the project so that later it makes an overall improvement and gets received well by customers, they are to also review the contents of the website and speak with its developers if they run into any bugs or issues so that its fixed early on and not left till last minute once the project is finalized. </p>

<h3>Group Processes and communications</h3>

  <p><em>Communication was described by the Assessment as one of the most important parts of the project - often the component that would have most influence over 'making' or 'breaking' the success of the project.  This section analyses the communcation processes between group members, and answers such questions as: How will your group communicate? How often will meetings take place? Will these be face-to-face, or using technologies such as Skype? Or Facebook? Or email? Or text? Or ...?? What will you do if you have a group member who does not respond to communications? </em></p>

  <p>Group processes and communications were set out during the first meeting of the group.  The main method of communication is through the following: </p>

  <p>Canvas Outlook – emails were sent back and forth in the first early few weeks to group to decide what to do and  </p>

  <p>Communication between group members is one of the most important components which can make or break a team.  It is incredibly important that people can negotiate, and problem solve together during each part of the project, including between meetings as often problems with an idea or concept change might be necessary before completing a specific task by an agreed date. </p>

  <p>One of the ways our team decided to communicate was to rely only upon Outlook and Microsoft Team.  This way no one was excluded from any of the discussions that were taking place and it met the specifications for the Assignment.  It was important to all of us that our conversations and negotiations were all equally valid. </p>

  <p>Outlook was an important tool – we used this to send emails to each other and allowed the last member of the group, Trillion, to gain access to Microsoft Teams, which then became the dominant form of all communications, especially for our meetings.  Microsoft Teams was used in many ways including for meetings, chatting, and sharing specs and files. </p>

  <p>Our meetings were decided to take place three times a week, more often than necessary but a useful idea because with increased frequency work could potentially move along faster.  This also improved connectivity between members and helped establish repour and friendships with each other; as there was a new member in the group a new dynamic was formed very easily with these extra meetings.  It also allowed the group to catch up as work had been hindered by poor communication in the first two weeks.  With a group comprising at least two essential workers in separate states it was sometimes not possible for all members to partake in meetings at the same time, but happily at least two out of three were able to attend the meetings each time. </p>

  <p>As we were separated by many hundreds of kilometres Microsoft Meetings was one of the only ways our group could meet. </p>

  <p>One of the first things to come up in group discussion was the lack of contact from the other members in the group.  Although there is a count of seven on Canvas there are in actuality only three members who wrote materials towards this Assessment 3, namely Trill, Adam and Valantino (with Lukes’ material added in the first two weeks by Trill, but who never made any contact).  This was discussed as early as the first two meetings and in the second it was decided that if a member became inactive for a period of around a week at this late date we would just complete their materials. </p>

  <p>If a group member was inactive for a period of more than a few weeks we would overtake everything they needed to do and we would give them no contribution share on the project.  This was something the group decided to do as a whole in part due to the number of things facing the completion of this project, and partly because of the time available to us. </p>

  <p>Communication was often through Microsoft Team chats, in which the members communicated information about the project such as due dates or presentation strategies everyone could see the materials and access them.  In this way we incorporated everyone’s input and expression. </p>
